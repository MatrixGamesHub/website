          This is a framework that provides the ability to quickly and easily create games based
          on a two-dimensional matrix like Sokoban, Bomberman or maze puzzles in general. The
          playing field consists of rows and columns, and each intersection is defined by a cell.
          Each cell can contain objects (walls, items, players, opponents, etc.) that represent the
          structure of the game.
